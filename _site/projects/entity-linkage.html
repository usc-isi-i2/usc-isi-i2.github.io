This often leads to unsatisfactory results because the sources are often missing information or contain incorrect or outdated information. We are addressing this problem by developing the technology to build massive entity knowledgebases, which we call EntityBases.  The key idea is to create a comprehensive knowledgebase for the entities of interest (e.g., companies).  In order to build such a knowledge base, we must address the issues of linking entities with multi-valued attributes obtained from heterogeneous sources and providing a virtual repository that can be efficiently queried.</td>

Sharbaf&quot; (even though the documents come from the same government agency).  Different transliterations of foreign names, such as in this case, would foil simple match techniques. The multiplicity of names that refer to the same real-world entity is not limited to people --- other entities, such as companies and locations, exhibit the same phenomenon. For exam-ple, both &quot;Isfahan&quot; and &quot;Esfahan&quot; are common transliterations for the same Iranian city.</td>

The blocking process efficiently identifies candidates that appear consistent with the information we know.

It also evaluates the other candidates and identifies similar differences.  In evaluating the candidates, the linkage phase associates metric scores to quantify the similarity (or lack there of).  A second part of the linkage process evaluates the similarities/dissimilarities and then judges the implications of such scores.  For example, the linkage process could have identified that Corp is just a common company formation acronym (like &quot;Inc.&quot; or &quot;LLP&quot;) and that the missing &quot;Ali&quot; from the person&rsquo;s name is not critical (as opposed to a mismatch on last name, for example).</td>

The EntityBase may provide many candidates (e.g., entity #12, #109 and #87190) even after applying the blocking process.  However, by exploiting the geospatial extents of these entities, the system can deduce additional infor-mation to narrow down the relevant entities.  For example, the company mentioned in the document is located within area X shown in Figure 3. The system infers that entity #109 is located within area X as well (based on its &quot;phone&quot; attribute).  It also infers that the companies of the entities #12 and #87190 are located within area Y (based on their associated &quot;phone&quot; attribute).  This in turn implies lower similarity between the company mentioned in the document and the two entities #12 and #87190.</td>
